           <h1>Homework 1 process</h1> 
           <p>This page shows the processes I took while completing Homework assignment 1.
               I appologize in advance for some lack of documentation. It's not my strongest skill
               and I will work on it for future assignments to come.
           </p>



           <h3>Step 1: Setup</h3>
           <p>I already had a GitHub account from a previous class however I believed it would be easier for me,
               mentally, to create a new account that is designated for this class' assignments only. I already had 
               Windows subsystem for Lynix set up. I went ahead and updated my user name and user email for GitHub 
               and then I checked my status to make sure my repository was empty.

           <h3>Step 2: Content/Coding</h3>
           <p>I began this process with downloading Bootstrap and then followed through the rest of the instructions
               in this section to complete my website.
            </p>
            <p>I began with creating the navigation bar with main title/logo of my website along side it. I would like 
                to note that the image for my logo was downloaded from the Noun Project and I am giving credit to Ealancheliyan s, the 
                artist who designed the icon. It is not my own design.
            </p>
            <img src="images\step2a.png" width="700" height="400">
            <p>For this section of the code I followed along a tutorial, done by w3 newbie, of using bootsrtap to 
                create a navigation bar. I really thought this was a cool navigation bar because when the size of the 
                screen becomes smaller the navigation bar changes into a drop-down menu when selected. I had a few hiccups along the 
                way in getting it to work properly and that wasn't until I nearly completed my website. The code for the navigation
                bar is in each of my three html files.
            </p>
            <img src="images\step2b.png" width="700" height="230"><br>
            <p>The image above shows the full navigation bar. This would be seen on a medium or larger screen.</p>
            <img src="images\step2c.png" width="700" height="800">
            <p>The image above shows the navigation bar transformed into a drop-down menu when the screen is a small size.</p>
            <p>I then switched my focus to creating the column layouts using bootsrtap. On my website home page, HW1.html, I have used both a 
                single and a three column layout. The top container of the home page is in a single column layout with a header and 
                paragraph element inside.
            </p>
            <img src="images\step2d.png" width="700">
            <p>Inside the three column layout I decided to place the three images of pets. While working on this section I looked
                to bootstraps documentation as well as the w3 newbie tutorial.
            </p>
            <img src="images\step2e.png" width="700">
            <p>Next I went on to creating a table. This is in my HW1-contacts html file. I figured that using a table for my "contacts" would 
                be the most reasonable way to use one. I had created with table with HTML and didn't realize till later that there was a way to 
                format it in bootsrtap. I was in a pinch for time and decided to keep to the HTML.
            </p>
            <img src="images\step2f.png" width="700">
            <p>Moving along, we arrive to the creation of the tables. I chose to create an ordered and an unordered list. Similar to the 
                table I had stuck to using HTML. My ordered list is in the HW1.html file and my unordered list is in the HW1-community.html file.
                Here is the code for the two lists below.
            </p>

            <br>
            <img src="images\step2h.png" width="700">



            <h3>Step 3: Getting Everything onto GitHub</h3>
            <p>After completing the website now it was time to add and push all my files onto GitHub. I had quite a bit of trouble with this.
                I had a hard time getting into the directory I wanted to be my local repository. Eventualy, after pulling a few hairs from my
                head, I got to where I needed to be. I go on to add, commit and push my files to my repository. Below are images of this process.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 4: Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Last but no least, was shaping my portfolio into a visual presentation of my liking. Looking at examples, I noticed, that the page
                for their blog was the same theme as their portfolio home page. I don't know how to link another GitHub Page (my blog) to my 
                home GitHub Page (if that's what I'm supposed to do, I could be looking at it wrong). At this point I am running short on time so I decided that I would create this basic HTML page for my blog. I 
                kept it simple by using a header, paragraph and img src elements. This following week I'll talk to my fellow classmates on how to 
                have a blog page with the same theme as my portfolio home page. I've got a feeling that I was overthinking how to do it.
