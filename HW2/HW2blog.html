                <h1>Homework 2 process</h1>
                <p>This page shows the steps and processes I took in developing and 
                    creating this assignment.
                </p>

                <h3>Planning & Design</h3>
                <p>At the start of this assignment we each were to think of an idea
                    for a form that would take in user input, do some sort of calculation
                    and then provide an output to the user. This took me a while to think
                    of an idea as I wanted to keep it simple. I thought to myself, what is
                    something that would be useful for me to use right now? Then it clicked!
                    I had decided that I would create a homework tracker. Below is a rough 
                    sketch on what I wanted to create.    
                </p>
                <img src="images2\HW2sketch.jpg" width="400" height="500">
                <p>I decided to call this tracker "On Time!" It only made sense because the goal 
                    for students is to turn in their assignments on time as often as possible. 
                    I decided that I would work with one container/column. I didn't want to go 
                    into too much detail with trying to work with two or more columns. 
                </p>
                <h3>Content & Coding</h3>
                <p>As far as creating forms in Bootstrap I had little to no knowledge on how to 
                    create one. I looked into the Bootstrap documentations and was able to find 
                    some guideance there. As I was going thorugh the code there were a few details 
                    starting to form that I didn't fully consider in my sketch. For example, the 
                    "placeholder" that I could add inside of each text box. It was something I had 
                    considered when notifying the user about the date input but at the time it 
                    didn't occur to me to also give the user an example of what to insert into the 
                    class name and assignment name text boxes.
                </p>

                <img src="images2\image2.png">
                <p>For the text boxes I had decided to display them in a list so that they would 
                    be formatted one on top of the other on my site. I used an unordered list. My only 
                    issue with this part of the code was that I wish I was able to have the little 
                    bullet points removed for visual purposes but that is a problem to solve for another day for me. 
                    Looking at the picture below you can see one of my text boxes being defined inside 
                    of a list element "li".
                </p>
                <img src="images2\image10.png" width="400">
                <p>My biggest challenge with this assignment was learning how to use Javascript. 
                    There was a lot of time spent trying to figure out if my user input was being 
                    received. Through much trial and error with different variations of code, it was 
                    brought to my attention by one of my classmates to use the "console.log()" 
                    function. Boy, how I have learned how helpful that little tool was! 
                </p>
                <img src="images2\image3.png" width="700" height="400">
                <img src="images2\image4.png" width="530" >
                <p>In the picture above with the snip-bit of code, this shows how I was able to use 
                    the "console.log()" function to, in essence, debug my code and see where my user 
                    input was going after the "Submit" button was clicked. In the next picture above 
                    you can see in the Developer Tools where my "console.log()" is printing out its 
                    information. The first four lines in my console window show that the code is running 
                    through each line in my function submitAssign() and showing the values from each text 
                    box after the submit button has been clicked on. The next four lines are for my 
                    output in Javascript. I again used the "console.log()" (see image below) to make sure 
                    each element was receiving the correct input and it is.
                </p>
                <img src="images2\image5.png" width="530" >
                <p>Now my next challenge was to have the output appear on the html site. I wanted each 
                    input to be displayed in a list for the viewer to see. I also wanted there to be an 
                    option for the user to delete any one of the items in the list for when an assignment 
                    was completed. Naturally I made this more difficult to execute at the beginning of this 
                    process but I then came across a similar idea from a previous student. I have borrowed 
                    and modified some of that code from that student to help me with this section of my code. 
                </p>

                <img src="images2\image12.png" width="600">
                <p>The modifications that I did to this borrowed code was that I wanted my inputs (now back as 
                    outputs) to be read of as a statement within the discription list. At the end of the statement 
                    there is a "Assignment Complete" button. This will allow the user to remove an assignment 
                    that is done. Here is where I have a technical issue. The user is able to remove an assignment, 
                    however, it removes the full list and when you go to enter in another assignment the code doesn't 
                    work. For the time being I will have to leave it this way and when I have some extra time I will 
                    come back to this and try to solve the issue. After you have pressed Assignment Complete, refreshing 
                    the page will put the site back in working order (until you press that button again).</p>

                <h3>Git Merging & the Command Line</h3>
                <p>For this assignment we were to practice working on a feature branch and then merge that 
                    branch back to our master branch. In the command line we are able to see a visual of this 
                    combination of branching and merging.
                </p>
                <img src="images2\image8.png" width="600">
                <p>As I was submiting one of my previous commits you can see that the branch I was working 
                    on was ahead of my master branch by a commit. I then typed in a few git commands to sync 
                    my two branches back and prepared them for a merge (I forgot to grab a picture of that part).
                </p>
                <img src="images2\image9.png" width="600">
                <p>After completing my sync and push of my branches to git I went ahead and typed in a command 
                    to view a graph of the branching that occured in this homework assignment (as pictured above). 
                    As you can see to the far left of the image there is a visual of the branching.
