                <h1>Homework 1 process</h1>
                <p>This page shows the steps and processes I took in developing and 
                    creating this assignment.
                </p>

                <h3>Planning & Design</h3>
                <p>At the start of this assignment we each were to think of an idea
                    for a form that would take in user input, do some sort of calculation
                    and then provide an output to the user. This took me a while to think
                    of an idea as I wanted to keep it simple. I thought to myself what is
                    something that would be useful for me to use right now? Then it clicked!
                    I had decided that I would create a homework tracker. Below is a rough 
                    sketch on what I wanted to create.    
                </p>

                <p>I decided to call this tracker On Time! It only made sense because the goal 
                    for students is to turn in their assignments on time as often as possible. 
                    I decided that I will work with one container/column. I didn't want to go 
                    into too much detail with trying to work with two columns. 
                </p>
                <p>As far as creating forms in Bootstrap I had little to no knowledge on how to 
                    create one. I looked into the Bootstrap documentations and was able to find 
                    some guideance there. As I was going thorugh the code there were a few details 
                    starting to form that I didn't fully consider in my sketch. For example, the 
                    "placeholder" that I could add inside of each text box. It was something I had 
                    considered when notifying the user about the date input but at the time it 
                    didn't occur to me to also give the user an example of what to insert into the 
                    class name and assignment name text boxes.

                <p>My biggest challenge with this assignment was learning how to use Javascript. 
                    There was a lot of time spent trying to figure out if my user input was being 
                    received. Through much trial and error wit didn't variations of code it was 
                    brought to my attention by one of my classmates to use the "console.log()" 
                    function. Boy, how I have learned how helpful that little tool was! 
                </p>

                <img src="images2\image4.png" width="500" height="200">
                <p>In the picture above with the snip-bit of code, this shows how I was able to use 
                    the "console.log()" function to, in essence, debug my code and see where my user 
                    input was going after the "Submit" button was clicked. In the next picture above 
                    you can see in the Developer Tools were my "console.log()" is printing out its 
                    information.The first four lines in my console window show that the code is running 
                    through each line in my function submitAssign() and showing the values from each text 
                    box after the submit button has been clicked on. The next four lines are for my 
                    output in Javascript. I again used the "console.log()" (see image below) to make sure 
                    each element was receiving the correct input and it is.
                </p>
                <img src="images2\image5.png" width="530" height="200">
                <p>Now my next challenge was to have the output appear on the html site. I wanted each 
                    input to be displayed in a list for the viewer to see. I also wanted there to be an 
                    option for the user to delete any one of the items in the list for when an assignment 
                    was completed. Naturally I made this more difficult to execute at the beginning of this 
                    process but I then came across a similar idea from a previous student. I have borrowed 
                    and modified some of that code from that student to help me with this section of my code.
